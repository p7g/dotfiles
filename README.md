# My vim configuration

*Should* work in Linux and Windows, with vim and neovim.

This config features:
* automatic vim-plug install
* relative numbers on the active split
* some nice colorschemes and some choice plugins
* a clean statusbar
* some Colemak key bindings that you probably don't want
* some mappings to run node and php scripts with `<localleader>r`
* undo files, backup files and swp files in the config directory
