# My vim configuration

*Should* work in Linux and Windows, with vim and neovim.

This config automatically installs vim-plug, relative numbers on the active split, as well as some nice colorschemes and some choice plugins. It has a clean statusbar, some Colemak key bindings that you probably don't want, as well as some mappings to run node and php scripts with `<localleader>r`. It saves undo files, as well as backup files and swp files in the config directory, so they carry over between sessions and don't pollute your repositories.
