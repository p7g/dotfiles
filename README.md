# My dotfiles

## vim config `.vimrc`

*Should* work in Linux and Windows, with vim and neovim.

This config features:
* automatic vim-plug install
* relative numbers on the active split
* some nice colorschemes and some choice plugins
* a clean statusbar
* some Colemak key bindings that you probably don't want
* some mappings to run node and php scripts with `<localleader>r`
* undo files, backup files and swp files in the config directory

## ksh config `.kshrc`

I'm not sure why I decided to use ksh, but whatever. This should also work in most other shells.

This config features:
* non-zero exit code in PS1
* basename of current directory, or ~ if $HOME
* not much else
